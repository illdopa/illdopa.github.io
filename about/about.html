<p>As a UX designer, I am inspired by creativity, collaboration and an omnipresent user-centered focus.</p>
<p>My background in science has instilled an adherence to the scientific method, which has subsequently guided a similarly observant, empathetic and iterative design process.</p>
<p>I have extensive experience working with a small team in a fast-paced startup environment. As a result, I've cultivated a full-spectrum product and design skillset - from product thinking and user research, to wireframes and prototypes to creating pixel-perfect UIs.</p>
<p>If you're interested in working together or learning more about my process feel free to contact me.
When I'm not designing things you can usually find me running or making music.</p>
<h3>Some Of My Favorite Design Tools</h3>
<p>Sketch, Adobe Photoshop, Keynote, Omnigraffle, Framer.js, HTML, CSS, pen and paper</p>
