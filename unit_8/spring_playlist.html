			<h3>Spring: A rhythm-based music service for exercise (iOS)</h3><br>
			<h2>Problem</h2>
			<p>Some users unsatisfied with the existing radio-style listening experience, which relies on user ratings + algorithm. </p>
			<h2>Goal</h2>
			<p>Through data and user research, understand pain points associated with the radio experience.</p>
			<h2>Solution</h2>
			<p>It was concluded that users who positively rated artists and songs were disappointed with the frequency of hearing what they liked. Furthermore, data indicated that user satisfaction was equivalent for listeners who did not make lots of ratings.</p>
			<p>Curated and themed workout playlists were designed. Playlists have no user rating component and do not rely on the song picking algorithm.</p>

				<h3>Iterations For Playlist Menu</h3>
				<p>Early iterations didn't address BPM ranges. They only focused on genres/themes.</p>
				<p>Later iterations were both activity and BPM inclusive.</p>
				<p>Some playlists not confined to BPM ranges. This was an experiment to see user interest in BPM based music workouts vs. traditional music playlists.</p>

				<h3>Iterations For Playlist Overview</h3>
				<p>Primary emphasis on the featured artists. A short, motivating tagline was added to highlight playlist theme.</p>
				<p>User testing indicated that 6 featured artists was enough to pique interest.</p>
				<p>User testing also showed that artist images were frequently mistaken for buttons.
				Artist images were altered to look less button-like.</p>

				<h3>BPM Scroll</h3>
				<p>To de-clutter, BPM selection was moved to a new screen. Non BPM-specific playlists proceed directly to the play view.</p>
				<p>Scroll design is a stripped down version of the familiar scroll from radio-mode.</p>
